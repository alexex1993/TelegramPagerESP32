# The audio recorder based on ESP32 and IMP441 (I2S) with saving WAV-files to MicroSD

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2c3cde85-9fc2-4634-b6c5-806b858d65eb)

Need components:
1) ESP32(S3) board
2) SSD1306 OLED Display
3) MicroSD HC card

Optional: Adapter for MicroSD Card or use ESP32S3 with internal microsd adaoter (in my case)

## Features
- Support IMP441 or other I2S microphone
- Support MicroSD HC Cards
- Audio Recording after start ESP32 or reset button on ESP32
- Name of file use randomly for several recordings
- Format audio: wav raw
- Possibility to choose: record duration, volume level, buffer size and sample rate

## Getting started

0) Setting up your Arduino IDE for ESP32 Boards
1) Connect your ESP32 Board
2) Connect microphone and microsd to GPIO
3) Upload this code to your ESP32

## How to connect microphone

| ESP32(S3) Board | IMP441 |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| GND   | GND   |
| 3V3 | VCC   |
| GND | L/R |
| D15    | WS   |
| D16    | SCK  |
| D17    | SD   |

## How to connect MicroSD
```
#define SD_MMC_CMD 38 // CMD pin for SD_MMC
#define SD_MMC_CLK 39 // CLK pin for SD_MMC
#define SD_MMC_D0  40 // D0 pin for SD_MMC
```
Please, show examples for `SD_MMC.h` and your microsd adapter
